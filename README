## Project Overview

The movie recommendation system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict and recommend movies to users. The model is trained on movie ratings data and uses algorithms like **KNN** or **Matrix Factorization** to make recommendations based on past user behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System
    ```
    
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the movie recommendation script:
    ```bash
    python movie_recommender.py
    ```
    This script will prompt the user to input preferences or movie ratings, and based on that, it will recommend movies from the dataset.

2. If you want to run the web app (if built using Flask or Streamlit), use:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will launch a local web server where users can interact with the recommendation system.

## Dataset

This project uses the **MovieLens** dataset, which contains user ratings for movies. You can download the dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Alternatively, if you already have the dataset, place the file `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` in the project directory.
